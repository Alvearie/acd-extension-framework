# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. 

# In this example, the user owns any files in the repo/acd-annotator-python
# directory and any of its subdirectories. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies these files, only this user and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.

## match all js files
#*.js    @js-owner

## You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
## used to look up users just like we do for commit author
## emails.
#*.go docs@example.com
#
## The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
## `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
## `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
#docs/*  docs@example.com
#
## In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
## anywhere in your repository.
#apps/ @octocat
#
## In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
## directory in the root of your repository and any of its
## subdirectories.
#/docs/ @doctocat
