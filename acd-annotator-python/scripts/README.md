# Scripts
This directory contains some very simple utility scripts. 
These are meant to serve as a reminder for how 
to do common operations (debug the server, install dependencies, etc.).

All of these tests are meant to be run from the main project directory. For example:
```
bash ./scripts/run_server.sh
```
